# hypixel-bot ðŸŽ®âœ¨

This is a small hobby-project that I started on 2017-03-14. I've slowly been working on it as a side-project and for fun, really.

The code was a complete mess of spaghetti, though, as it originally started as a private guild-only bot designed to check statistics for people who applied to the guild. I decided to completely rewrite it. (2017-09-29)

It was split into two separate projects - [hypixel.py](https://github.com/Snuggle/hypixel.py), a Python wrapper with common functions for the public Hypixel-API, and the bot itself.
